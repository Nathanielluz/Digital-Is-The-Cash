*FOREWORD*

Since money's invention millenia ago, it has played an increasingly
critical role in civilization and our everyday lives. Many individual
hopes and dreams center around having more of it or owing less of
it. It lubricates commerce to enrich our economies. Indeed, empires
rise or fall because of it. Today, money has an almost mythical status
in society.

For something that plays such a central role in our lives and
civilization, most people spend shockingly little time thinking about
what constitutes money, or considering whether the currency they
use is high-quality. In most countries, citizens have little incentive to
question what specific currency they should use. There are
tremendous benefits to utilizing the same currency that is most
common in local commerce, which is most often the local
government issued currency or a major international currency such
as the U.S. dollar.

That mythical status is not surprising when you consider what the
invention of money has enabled. Nearly every good or service in a
modern economy would be impossible within a barter system. It is
hard to imagine a world in which automobiles, rockets, or
chemotherapy drugs could be invented and mass produced without
the invention of money. The economic value that was unlocked
when money was created is simply staggering.

This has not always been the case. In the past, many currencies
would circulate in parallel to drive trade. The quality and value of
these currencies would be constantly reassessed in the course of
trade. This process still happens today on international markets, but
is notably absent from day-to-day transactions of small merchants
and individuals.

Digital currencies are the latest innovation in money, and they
address quite a number of end-user shortcomings of the government-issued currencies that dominate the market today.

They are the first currencies that are natively digital in an
increasingly digital world. They are counterfeit-proof, inflation
resistant (or even deflationary), and low-cost compared with the
high cash-handling costs of physical cash or card fees.

We are entering a period in which money innovation is accelerating
for the first time in nearly a century. This innovation has the potential
to unlock incredible value, just like money innovations before it. It is
my belief that the benefits of digital currencies will cause
tremendous positive disruption across the world in our financial
systems. This transition will take time, but seems inevitable.

Given their potential, I encourage you, the reader, to learn about the
innovations that are occurring and monitor the adoption of digital
currencies. Evaluate whether they can be useful to you or your
business. Make a conscious decision regarding the role they should
play in your financial repertoire. We are living in a time of great
change, and nothing is more fundamental to the success of the
human race than money. It is especially exciting to be living in a
moment when money itself is being improved in such fundamental
ways.
