*AUTHOR'S NOTE*

I've attempted to simplify the past, present and future of
money in one easy read. The extent of my success will
ultimately be decided by you, the reader.

A blend of history, finance, and technology, an aim at getting
more and more people to see the obvious, where the
prevalent global financial system is headed and how they can
prepare themselves.

With governments trying unsuccessfully to salvage the global
economic situations, rate of inflation skyrocketing in Latin
America and Africa, people trying to save their money in a
currency that'll still be relevant in the next decades, there's
not a time this book has been more needed!

Will there be another global recession? Will more people lose
hope on fiat money? Will Digital Cash become the prevalent
currency of the future? Is cryptocurrency really a bubble?

This book expounds on those and others.

This book contains no financial, investment or legal advice. It
contains purely the thoughts of the author as translated into
words. Always *D* o *Y* our *O* wn *R* esearch and bear full
responsibility for your decisions.

Happy reading.
