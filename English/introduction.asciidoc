*INTRODUCTION*

The world of finance is fast changing. Ever since the financial crisis
between 2007-2009, the global economy has seen the development
of rapid changes sweep over it. Previously, stalwart and trusted
institutions sank into bankruptcy and obscurity. “Bail-outs,” “bailins,” and all manners of quantitative easing and financial maneuvers have been used by world governments, central banking authorities
and global financial institutions and it has turned the heretofore
well-trusted financial service industry on its head and left it reeling
from a global lack of confidence.

Seemingly held together by duct-tape, the proverbial sword of
Damocles hangs over the head of today's financial leaders as they
seek to maintain the (illusion of) control that central banking and fiat
money printing have given us over the last couple centuries in
various forms. The modern form that we see is merely a final
evolution of the original banking system, which itself was based on
the colonial exploits of European powers during the 1490s until the
1950s.

The history of the stock market and other banking institutions is
mired in slavery, war-for-profit, conquest, genocide and money
laundering. These behaviors take a toll on society as a whole,
especially when they're being financed by the world's largest
institutions and financial corporations. From the 1500s until now,
the modern debt-based economy runs on war, destruction and
death. From Yemen, to Vietnam, to World Wars I and II, the
Napoleonic conquests, the siege and defeat of the French, British
and Spanish in Haiti in 1804, wars in South Africa between the
British, the Boers and the native South Africans, all of these conflicts
can be traced back to the corrupt and decrepit financial system that
funds these conflicts and encourages their excess.

“Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation and I care not
who makes its laws!” - Mayer Amschel Rothschild

With all of this context as a background, cryptocurrencies were
introduced in 2009 as a response to these excesses. By completely
disintermediating the issuance of money from centralized sources of
control, cryptocurrencies allow for inflation, issuance rate and other
properties of money to be decided in advance and democratically.
Unlike the fiat federated reserve system where you are born into a
country and have little recourse which currency you will use,
cryptocurrencies are completely voluntary.

Furthermore, unlike fiat notes, cryptocurrencies are not just tokens
or means of exchange, cryptocurrencies are actually decentralized,
distributed assets. With the exception of USD, most currencies don't
find much use if any at all outside of their issuing country of origin.
Cryptocurrencies are global, decentralized, always on and always
available. Which means they are tradable on the global markets
wherever you are, whenever.

This gives you unprecedented financial freedom, never before seen.
In this book, you will get an introduction and background to the
history of the current financial system up till now and also be
introduced to the wonderful solutions that have been gifted to us to
combat the financial excesses that we have endured for so many
generations.

Until Dash, a popular fork of Bitcoin which is also the subject of
Chapter 5 of this course and then other privacy coins for example it
was nearly impossible to have fungible cash. If you've ever seen the
television series “Better Call Saul” or “Breaking Bad”, you will have
the great lengths that individuals, banks, businesses and more
unsavory individuals go to in order to have true financial privacy.
Because the banking system doesn't afford this easily. Every bill and
account is tracked with your name on it. Which makes financial
auditors' jobs very easy, but financial privacy for the individual goes
out the window.

This is just one of the many new possibilities that are opened up by
cryptocurrencies. In this book, we will explore more about the benefits of cryptocurrencies, as well as some of their drawbacks and
possible mitigations for these. By the end of this book you should be
up to speed on the financial history of the modern world as well as its
bright new future with cryptocurrencies.
