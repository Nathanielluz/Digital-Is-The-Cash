*What is money?*

Money is defined by economics as anything that is generally accepted, a means of exchange of value, easily divisible, a store of value, scarce, precious and difficult to get.

Money isn't in the same class of commodities like cars and so on that people want just for its own sake, but people want money because of what they can buy with it. The purpose of money, therefore, is not intrinsically defined but extrinsically. One question can be asked: if someone were to pay you a certain value for the work you've done, would you prefer they pay in bags of salt or with fiat? In this imagined scenario, every other worker has the option to pick from a variety of other commodities varying from sugar to bamboo sticks and bottles of honey. Nevertheless, you would likely prefer to be paid in money notes (fiat) rather than in bags of salt.

Remember that any medium you picked will be commensurate with the value of the work you do and you would be paid in that form for the next ten years. Why will the likely response be to opt for paper money? Certain reasons can be given for this: First, you will have more salt than you or your family can consume; second, you may find it difficult to exchange salt with someone for some other thing you prefer — a phenomenon called “double coincidence of wants” in the barter system. One other difficulty is measuring the balance in prices, that is, ascertaining what quantity of sugar would be equal to a certain amount of salt. If you were to exchange that salt with a horse, what quantity of salt would be equal to a horse, or what will be the equivalent value of one bag of salt when compared with the horse.

These problems would however not surface if you were paid in salt, every other worker was paid in salt, there were specific measures of salt in valuing the worth of other commodities and salt was generally acceptable across the members of the populace. You would simply exchange your salt for whatever other commodity you needed, not need to find someone who specifically needs salt and has a specified value attached to it. The salt would not then be purchased because it is needed, but because it could get what is needed. A person who would never taste salt would still acquire it because it would help him acquire other things he needs. In this scenario, salt takes the place of money as we will come to understand.

Similarly, the money notes we carry around are useless in themselves, just as a bank notification reflecting ones account balance is. However, both are representation of value which can be exchanged for another good or service or as a gift, reward etc. by transferring the notes to another, or transferring the credit an account holder has with his debtor banker to another. They are only useful because they represent value. Money provides the holder a purchasing power and though a note would not depreciate on the surface, inflationary factors can cause its worth to fall.

Money is a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value and a means of payment. Losing any of these qualities simply makes it revert to what it would have been in its ordinary form: a coin or a note. A US dollar note, though a unit of account, a means of payment and a form of storing wealth will remain a note as it won't be accepted in exchange for goods in a market in Estonia, for example, since it is not accepted as a general means of exchange there.


*Origin of money*

Money is anything that is generally acceptable as a means of exchange of goods and services. Note that the words “generally acceptable” in the definition give us a very strong idea about what money is. “Acceptance” is the word! It means anything that a group of people accepts as a means of exchange can be regarded as money – whether stones, feathers, paper, precious metals, or even words. Many have asked about how money came to be, or more properly, how old money is. The truth is that money can be dated to as far back as when communication began, because even the earliest forms of communication actually featured money in their lingo. Safely, one can conclude that money started out as an idea that a group of people accepted.

In the primitive years, we saw money exist in the barter system, where people exchanged one item for another – this was also idealistic. Much later, we saw the use of objects like stones, cowries, feathers and so on, which have no inherent value but became means of exchange because of an acceptance of them by a group of people. As man began to develop over the years, precious metals were discovered, which had value inherent in them. These precious metals like gold, silver and so on, soon became a means of exchange. It's a long history until now that we mostly use paper money, which is powered, controlled and supported by the banking sector and the government.

Today, we have cryptocurrencies, a monetary system that is both virtual and decentralized, unlike the traditional monetary system which is the exact opposite. Cryptocurrencies promise a whole lot to the financial sector, but if they're to be accepted, they must be simple for people to adopt and use in their everyday lives.

Money, in the course of history, has undergone a tremendous transformation in the same way humans have undergone considerable advancement. From the use of barter to the use of generally accepted commodities, to paper money, to monetary value stored in digital formats down to the creation of cryptocurrencies, money has evolved in accordance with the growth of finance, expansion of economic needs and technological innovation. Money is one of the things which seem to defy matter, as it has changed from the heavy, hugely visible and massive space occupying commodity it was to some forms which are untouchable, weightless and only occupy digital memory.

*Barter*

The first types of value transaction was the exchange of whatever good or service you could offer for another. In the barter system, people who had goods in excess of what they could consume would seek for others who had the exact item they want in excess (double coincidence of wants). When they found them, they'll exchange the items and each will leave for his house happily. Barter is the first form of human transaction and basically remains the form of value transaction between animals. Barter is as old as human and it is found in other living things, as the symbiotic relationships between plants and animals is a form of exchange in itself.

If Alice, in an imagined scenario had a bag of potatoes she would love to exchange for a cloth, she'd have to find someone else, Bob, who has an interest in potatoes and is able to provide cloth in exchange for it. In a situation where Alice has potatoes and Bob has cloth both in excess of what they could consume, but Bob wants apples instead, barter between both of them would be impossible as both of them do not have corresponding needs. To solve this problem, Bob might have to hold the cloth and look for someone who desires it and also possesses apples. The complexity of diverse, non-corresponding needs pose numerous problems to trade by barter as there were endless quests for corresponding needs, which became further deepened by an expanding market of products. The barter system had problems of divisibility and value measurement — the questions of, for example, the number of bunches of bananas that would be equal to a tuber of potatoes, or the quantity of a cow that would be equivalent to an apple.

The problems barter exchange posed, particularly the need for a double coincidence of wants, led to the evolution of a better form of barter, the exchange of goods for generally accepted goods — this system of barter is still present today in some places in the world. Traders at the Esuk Mba market in Akpabuyo, Calabar, Southern Nigeria are bartering to combat growing inflation.

The ancient practice in the capital of Cross River State was started in 1956 and still operates on a barter trade system, where no money is exchanged for goods in the weekly market that starts from 7 a.m and ends at noon every Saturday. Traders say it has helped them over the years to save cost in view of the scarce financial resources. In environments that are mainly production focused, it is common to see products being exchanged as a form of trade. The Esuk Mba market operates in an environment dominated by agriculturists. Gift exchange is also a form of barter which has not been replaced with better alternatives yet.

*Commodity money*

Goods with intrinsic values acted as currencies. They included animal skins, salt, cutlery, cowries, gold, silver and weapons. Known as commodity money, these goods served as the medium of exchange and units of measurement, though the unit values were quite negotiable. However, commodity goods had the problem of storage, measurement and particularly, the transportation of the goods for exchange. They were also susceptible to positive and negative supply shocks, which cause price volatility and make them unstable for use as a store of value and unit of account.

*Primitive Money*

All forms of commodity money aside the use of precious metals make up primitive money. It was used before the invention and even far into the 17th century as can be seen with the use of tobacco as a legal tender in Virginia and manillas in West Africa as late as 1949. Shells, feathers, beads nuts are also forms of primitive commodity money.

*Precious metals*

Metal objects emerged as a form of money as far back as 5000BC. At first, it was traded in its natural state, then it started being transformed into objects such as rings, bracelets and coins. All metals used for exchange had to be measured for purity and value in weight at every transaction; consequently, the metals, after taking more definite shapes had a measured value, form and weight, providing proper identification and a wider range of acceptance. Metals were more divisible, transportable and served as a great means of storing value. They gave way to coins, which were first recognized in China and, at one point or the other, have been used as a means of exchange globally.

*Paper money*

Paper money/fiat was created as an alternative to Gold. Fiat was backed by gold until the governments of the world took fiat money off the gold standard. Now money can be printed as much as the government and its allies want. It then employed the Central Bank to control the amount of money in circulation to prevent inflation.

According to Wikipedia, the first known banknote was first developed in China during the Tang and Song dynasties, starting in the 7th century. Its roots were in merchant receipts of deposit during the Tang dynasty (618–907), as merchants and wholesalers desired to avoid the heavy bulk of copper coinage in large commercial transactions. During the Yuan dynasty, banknotes were adopted by the Mongol Empire. In Europe, the concept of banknotes was first introduced during the 13th century by travelers such as Marco Polo, with European banknotes appearing in 1661 in Sweden.

Prior to the introduction of banknotes, precious or semi-precious metals minted into coins to certify their substance were widely used as a medium of exchange. The value that people attributed to coins was originally based upon the value of the metal, unless they were token issues or had been debased. Banknotes were originally a claim for the coins held by the bank, but due to the ease with which they could be transferred and the confidence that people had in the capacity of the bank to settle the notes in coin if presented, they became a popular means of exchange in their own right. They now make up a very small proportion of the "money" that people think that they have as 'demand deposit bank accounts,' and electronic payments have negated the need to carry notes and coins.

*Plastic money*

In the 1950s, a fiat payment type, credit cards were introduced, these plastic cards were used to make payments, in Nigeria debit cards “ATM cards” are used to make payments at POS terminals and online channels. It's amazing how money evolved to this level but there is still a problem of centralization, where the banks and government controls money.

*Network Money/ Cryptocurrency*

Money has evolved and taken a new form based on the age of the internet we are in. They are called cryptocurrencies and they are built on the blockchain. Fully permissionless and true digital cash, cryptocurrencies are spendable like the dollars, naira and euros, only that they are not owned by any central authority such as the government. Being digital cash, you can send them anywhere, anytime, instantly and at a very minimal fee.

Satoshi Nakamoto invented and launched the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, on January 3, 2009, which started a revolution in finance as money could now be sent via a peer-to-peer, decentralized network, like sending an email. This also means that anyone can use them! There is no segregation or discrimination as human identities are not required as a prerequisite for dealing in cryptocurrencies. Anyone can send money to anywhere totally borderless and censorship-resistant.
Cryptocurrencies give total control to the owner. No one controls your crypto and you can't control that of others also. Unlike bank accounts, they cannot be frozen or seized.
