*Blockchain Uses-Cases*

Blockchain technology is multidimensional. It can be deployed in existing and emerging innovative paradigms. Blockchain technology is often deemed as cryptocurrency, but that is limiting it to only one application from a pool of functions it can be used to perform. It goes beyond cryptocurrency and financial services traversing into all forms of businesses and technologies and it can be deployed in many ways and some of them are:

*Governance*

Blockchain technology can transform the models of governance of national governments and corporations. International organizations can also have more efficient models of governance through the integration of technology into administration. Blockchain technology can improve governance by facilitating a new model of voting, keeping the identity of citizens and through recording transactions, decisions and asset ownership. It can further be deployed in budgeting and management of public funds.

*Data storage*

The identity and records of citizens, as well as its proper documentation is essential for administration, but existing systems are inefficient to manage these needs. Identity documentation is prone to forgery, loss and difficulty verifying. The identity and records of citizens can be stored on the blockchain. Aside from that, criminal records, court records and even private records of individuals (wills, for instance) can be stored on the blockchain. It is also secure as it can be encrypted and easily verified.

Nations and organizations can also deploy blockchain technology in voting (elections). Voting via blockchain reduces the chances of manipulation, as results cannot be tampered with.  

*Healthcare*

The healthcare sector is reliant on the data of patients and the difficulty arising from the storage of a patient's data using traditional means (such as paper), or centralized digital forms are numerous. First, the data is inaccessible by anyone who does not have access to the central storage and patients will have to get essential details retaken. This wastes time and money. Storing a patient's data on the blockchain and allowing access by medical practitioners, patients, health insurance agencies and other necessary parties will help build tamper-proof data, ensure fast medical rendering service and appropriate recommendations by physicians and promote prompt payments by insurance companies.

*Supply Chain Management*

The movement of goods across borders is an important aspect of global trade. Supply chain management is aimed at improving trust in the delivery of goods and using the blockchain will make the process more transparent. Beyond the keeping of immutable records, the technology can help improve speed by reducing traditional friction points.

Blockchain can further be deployed in the supply of perishables (like food). The blockchain can be used to make the process of supply more transparent and traceable. It facilitates visibility and accountability of food supplies and it also makes details such as origin, storage and expiration date known to parties. IBM Food Trust does this, using blockchain. The solution connects participants such as farmers, processors, wholesalers, distributors, manufacturers, retailers, etc. through a permissioned, permanent and shared record of food origin details, processing data, shipping details and more.

Similarly, blockchain technology can be deployed in the shipping of goods. Over four trillion dollars worth of goods are shipped each year and the amount of money spent on documentation is huge. Global trade can be improved through the use of blockchain technology for documentation and transparency. Using blockchain technology in the shipping of goods will help create accessibility to fast and secure end-to-end supply chain information. It will also help create verifiable and authentic data that cannot be tampered with. As a result, it reduces the burden, difficulty and slowness of paperwork as it improves stock management.

*Real Estate*

The real estate and property industry can be made more efficient by utilising blockchain technology. It is one area that can be tremendously improved through the application of the technology, from the keeping of records of ownership, documenting of transfers and management of estates.

First, blockchain technology can be used to keep accurate records and make required modifications. With land ownership for instance, the owner of a piece of land can be documented and securely stored on the ledger. The storage on the ledger means that records cannot be forged since the storage is decentralized. This ensures that the transfer of property can be done in a transparent manner and the ownership of land can be verified, even  when it has been transferred. 

Blockchain can also be used to automate transactions, not simply for the purposes of speed and efficiency, but for security. Digital ownership certificates, for instance, can be programmed in a smart contract to get transferred after the deposit of a sum provided in the agreement. Mortgage activities are better processed and the costs that come from the presence of numerous middlemen is eliminated.

*Education and Issuance of Academic Certificates*

The nexus of blockchain technology and education transcends teaching about blockchain. The decentralization and disintermediation of the technology can help make certification more reliable and reputable. Many educational institutes now issue certificates on the blockchain.

*Energy*

Blockchain technology can have profound effects on the energy sector. It can aid the decentralization of the distribution, sale and transfer of energy. With this, energy can be sold and transferred between parties directly and without the need for third parties. The process of energy sales is made transparent as there is storage of the amount of energy generated and transferred by each party. Communities can also build an energy distribution system where households with excess energy (especially when generated through renewable means like solar) can transfer to others for a sum they desire and whenever they want.

*Smart Contracts, Property and Financial Instruments*

The practice of law is centralized and highly procedural, with laid down principles for every process. Furthermore, the practice of law is jurisdiction-based and the laws that apply and are enforced in different jurisdictions significantly vary. The enforcement of contracts is one area of law that is a daily requirement for human life, especially with trade. Blockchain technology has helped devise a way that contracts do not need to be jurisdiction-based and everyone can speak the same language in an automated contractual agreement that self-enforces itself without the need to resort to courts. IBM in their publication titled "Blockchain" defined a smart contract as 'an agreement or set of rules that govern a business transaction; it is stored on the blockchain and is executed automatically as part of a transaction'. It can also be referred to as smart agreements as they are contractual agreements that are implemented through the use of software. Smart contracts are advantageous because they can assure parity between parties to the contract, help enforce the performance of obligations and eliminate the possibility of default by any party to the contract.

Smart property is a concept that is reliant on smart contracts. Smart property arises from cryptographically enforced ownership that can be sold or lent digitally. Such transfers are subject to the provisions of a smart contracts between the parties.

Financial contracts and Instruments can derive huge benefits from the application of blockchain technology. Financial instruments are often based on rules set by the issuer, though there might be checked by security and exchange authorities for compliance where the financial market is regulated. However, these regulatory authorities often go through tedious, expensive and time-consuming processes to assess such rules, paving the way for efficiency through the use of blockchain technology. Algorithms (known as programming protocols) can be used to select rules and enforce their application. They can be used in the stock, commodities, indices, bonds and derivatives markets.

*Cryptocurrency and other financial applications*

Bitcoin is regarded as the first application of the blockchain and it remains one of the most common uses of the technology. Beyond Bitcoin, countries and their central banks, financial Organizations, companies and even individuals have created and are creating a number of cryptocurrencies regularly. Some of these cryptocurrencies are targeted at countries, regions, sectors or at addressing a particular issue. It is safe to state that the financial sector has witnessed the most widespread adoption of blockchain technology.

Cryptocurrency can be described as digital currency built through cryptography. It is based on decentralized trust and cryptography. Cryptocurrency is digital asset and it is often used as a digital value across many countries. Since the first Bitcoin transaction in 2009 and the opening of the first Bitcoin currency exchange site (Bitmarket) in 2010, many new cryptocurrencies, numerous transactions, pool of miners, exchange platforms and so on have come up. With a total market capitalization in billions of dollars, cryptocurrency is the most dominant use of blockchain technology. It is so popular that it is often mistaken to be the blockchain itself. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Stellar, Dash, Ripple etc. are popular cryptocurrencies.

There are four major sectors in cryptocurrency. They are exchanges (purchase, sale and trading of cryptocurrency), wallets (storage of cryptocurrency), payments (facilitating payments using cryptocurrency) and mining (ensuring the blockchain is secure through the computation of hashes and solving of algorithmic puzzles to find valuable blocks that will be added to the blockchain).

These four sectors make up majority of the cryptocurrency industry. The cryptocurrency ecosystem comprises of different participants who establish connections between blockchains, traditional existing financial institutions and the general public. The participants have embarked on projects that drive adoption by building applications that stimulate the use of cryptocurrency by public users. Cryptocurrency is being entrenched in the global economy as a vital component.

Beyond cryptocurrency, blockchain technology is used for other financial applications. For instance, blockchain ledgers are being used, even without cryptocurrency to facilitate monetary transactions across different currencies. Specially designed ledgers can ensure a seamless exchange between different national currencies. This important aspect of international trade, when placed on secure, permissioned blockchains will increase market liquidity and reduce transaction costs. Blockchain technology can be employed to increase funding for small and medium scale enterprises because of improved transparency and risk mitigation. Overall, these applications will create new revenue generating platforms for small and medium scale enterprises, foster increased trading, increase cross-border transactions, increase access to capital and promote overall trade and economic growth.

An organization might therefore make an assessment of the technology to see if it can help meet an organizational need or if it will be appropriate solution to a problem. They will have to identify the problem blockchain technology can solve (or an aspect it can help improve) and set the goals its application will achieve, pick the best consensus system (eg proof of work, proof of stake or select the most suitable platform and construct the architecture (cloud, in-house or a hybrid model).

The adoption of blockchain by organizations will propel further adoption and more innovations. All of these applications and many more resulting from the collaboration of blockchain technology with other emerging ones such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, internet of things, smart cities and robotics, digital trade, etc will birth thriving ideas and facilitate an all inclusive adoption globally.  

*Blockchain Technology and Africa*

Africa and the Middle East have one thing in common; they are home to a number of developing countries. These developing countries have suffered restrictions to the benefits of digitalization and globalization, ranging from poor access to outright exclusion. Blockchain technology is however encompassing and it has great potential for applications in different areas of private and public life. This becomes more promising when we consider that Africa has adequate human resources and can leverage on it's technological know-how to improve the continent. From the prospect of eradicating corruption and mismanagement in public sectors to improve the ease of doing businesses, blockchain technology is one that can help Africa actualize a transformation. The potential of the technology is one that can even make developing countries leapfrog others in their development.

A direct implication of the technology is the financial inclusion it provides for the unbanked populace. Subsaharan Africa has a large number of unbanked people and according to the Global Findex report, over half of the adults in Nigeria and Ethiopia are unbanked, while about one-third of Kenyans are financially excluded. Of the 25 countries that host 73% of unbanked adults globally, almost half of those countries are from the African continent, with eleven countries namely; Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Morocco, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa,and Zambia, as reported by the Universal Financial Access 2020. People remain unbanked because of the costs, the need for extensive paperwork and documentation and the distance to traditional financial institutions; blockchain technology can be used to address these issues.

The technology can help integrate the continent internal currency exchange system. Internal trade between African countries is more difficult than transacting outside the continent at times, particularly because of the absence of effective currency exchange platforms for African trade. Blockchain technology can act as an enabler for improved African trade, while also positioning her better for the global economy through the ease the technology brings to global trade.

By facilitating a better means for intracontinental and intercontinental trade, the use of cryptocurrency can help curtail Africa's huge expenditure on remittances. The Migration and Development Brief stated that the global average cost of sending remittances has remained high, at 7.2 percent in 2018 Q3, a rate which is way above the Sustainable Development Goal target. of 3 percent by 2030. Remittance charges can rise to nine percent when money is transferred to sub-Saharan Africa regions, according to the University of Nicosia's material titled " Digital Currency and the Developing World".

This potential advancement in financial inclusion will improve access to credit for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). It will increase the ease of doing business in Africa and can accelerate Africa's industrial and infrastructural growth. Financial inclusion will help individuals generate wealth, will help countries expand and will devise ways to tackle inflation.

*A Note to Regulators*

Regulatory bodies should embrace this disruptive technology and find channels to incorporate this digital concept with existing systems. The governments of African countries must be open to innovation and rather than resist it because of a misunderstanding of the technology or fear of the extent to which it can cause shifts in governance, they must create regulatory frameworks for it. Such frameworks must be designed to harness the benefits of the technology without frustrating its growth. Therefore, beyond stipulations on compliance, there must be collaboration between the government and key private economy players.

Africa has a chance for groundbreaking implementations of blockchain technology, if it does not utilize it, it will end up being a spectator.

Common misconceptions about Dash and rebuttals

*1. Dash isn't decentralized because of its masternodes*

There are over 4,500 masternodes, which makes Dash relatively more decentralized than other coins. Bitcoin has over 8,800 full nodes, but has a larger market cap. Bitcoin would have to have over 170,000 full nodes to achieve an equivalent level of decentralization as Dash. Masternodes are numerous because they are financially incentivized to serve the network, while Bitcoin nodes are not.

*2. The government could just buy all the masternodes and control the network*

Running a masternode requires putting forward collateral of 1,000 Dash. With price at $100, this represents a stake of $100,000 per masternode, and at $500, $500,000 in masternodes.

To buy half the masternodes at this price would cost $1.8 billion dollars IF the price did not rise during the attack. However, trying to buy this much Dash in the face of limited supply could easily cause the price to increase in multiples, making this a VERY expensive attack. This would be similar in nature to a 51% attack on Bitcoin mining – theoretically possible, but difficult and expensive.

*3. Dash price is artificially elevated because so much is “locked up” in masternodes*

The collateral for each masternode is not locked up. The masternode can be taken offline and the Dash sold at any time. The ratio of the amount of Dash backing masternodes is probably similar to Bitcoin held in cold storage. The difference is that masternodes serve the network and get paid to do it!

*4. Privatesend isn't private because master- nodes could spy on the network*

Masternodes are selected randomly in a PrivateSend mixing transaction and each coin is mixed on different masternodes multiple times before it can be spent via PrivateSend. Even if an attacker controlled 25% of the masternodes, the odds of tracking a transaction through 8 rounds of mixing is less than 0.004%.

*5. Dash has poor privacy because privatesend transactions are not mandatory*

Dash is fungible because it has optional mixing through PrivateSend (which has never been broken). If a merchant didn't want to accept mixed coins due to their unknown previous history, one could simply send them unmixed coins. Dash offers the best combination of privacy, instant transactions and a clear road map for on-chain scaling that is unrivalled by any other coin.

*6.  Dash is an instamine scam*

There are often challenges when issuing a new coin. Dash had no premine and did not have an ICO. However, due to a problem with the mining difficulty adjustment, approximately 1.9 million Dash were mined in the first 24 hours – a “fastmine”. The community was asked if this should be corrected by hard fork, but it was decided to leave it as is.

A distribution analysis shows a large portion of the quickly mined coins were simply dumped by the miners. This is reflected in the very low price between February and April 2014. Again from April to December of 2015, Dash traded for around $2 so it's hard to argue that no one had a chance to get in while it was cheap. Evan Duffield, Dash creator and the purported beneficiary of the instamine, controls no more than 256,000 Dash and will give away 80% of that to fund Dash projects in support of the community. He is still working hard on the project today. Evan also controls no masternodes or governance votes. For more information see the wiki entry on this topic at www.dash.org.

*7. It's a ponzi scheme because masternodes earn a return on their investment*

Masternodes must reserve 1,000 Dash as collateral and serve the network by running robust full nodes. In return, they earn 45% of the block rewards paid out when new blocks are mined. This currently provides an annual return of approximately 8% to masternode owners. With most currencies, 100% of the block reward is paid to miners, who spend most of the block reward on electricity and mining hardware. The Dash block reward is split to support miners, masternode operators and developers, so that all critical parts of the ecosystem are financially incentivized to thrive.

*8. It's just a marketing gimmick*

Dash is one of the fastest innovators in the cryptocurrency space. It boasts unique features such as InstantSend, PrivateSend, a masternode governance system and the world's first functioning DAO. It does fund promotional activities because very few people in the world are familiar with cryptocurrencies. We want everyone to have the opportunity to benefit from their many advantages over fiat currency.

Dash's unique block reward system reserves 10% of the block reward to support the development of the currency. Much of this is spent on the large number of full-time paid developers and a portion is also spent on promotional activities like conferences and marketing. This is an advantage that many newer currencies have copied from Dash.

*Dash is a next generation cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin, but with many improvements such as InstantSend, PrivateSend, financially incentivized masternodes and a decentralized self-funding governance system. (DashDude)*
