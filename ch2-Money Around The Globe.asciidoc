*The Global Financial Sector*

An effective finance sector is at the crux of global economic development, national prosperity and advancement in individual standards of living. A developed financial system helps promote economic development by facilitating capital accumulation, progress and increased utility of human and capital resources. It is instrumental to the efficient allocation of resources and high productivity. It leads to an expansion in utility creation, better risk assessment and management and convenient monetary transactions. A nation's financial sector cuts across insurance (which helps individuals and organizations cope with negative occurrences), investment (through the use of instruments that help gather resources and direct them to productive uses, erstwhile promoting saving, responsible consumption and financial sustainability), funding (providing capital for innovative and new enterprises) and banking (facilitating transactions, savings and numerous other functions). Financial sectors do not stand alone in individual countries however, there is an interconnectedness with a bigger financial setting; the global financial sector the sweeping waves of globalization.

Globalization is a dominant trend cutting across all facets of national and international relations; social, political and economic. It is most evident in the financial markets, mainly due to liberalization (a movement from national isolation to enhanced relationships across countries and regions of the world) and deregulation of economic processes, supported by the considerable scientific and technical advances in the area of information and communication technologies. Globalization is the integration of national economic systems into multilateral systems. This is facilitated by growth in international trade, investment and capital flows, financial integration, global labour fluidity, technological advancement and economic liberalism. Technological advancement has thinned out barriers and fostered integration in global economies and information and communication technology has helped establish connections between national and global markets.

It is important to assess the history of the global financial sector plays, its roles and challenges, its components and instruments, its future and its impact on the African continent.

*Brief History of the Global Financial Sector*

The modern global financial system dates back to the 19th century, but the history of the financial system goes further back than that. The early 20th century experienced a series of integration, disintegration and reintegrations, although major industrial countries could not avoid interactions. Maurice Obstfeld of the University of California detailed these phases in the history of modern financial history. In 1860, financial globalization was increasing and accelerating and every industrial power fixed their currency against the value of gold, creating the avenue to exchange at favourable rates. This increased confidence among foreign investors to pursue international transactions.

The outbreak of World War I, however, led to the collapse of this integrated world financial system. Integration then struggled to rebound during the 1920s and further plummeted during the Second World War. After that war ended in 1945, integration, according to Obstfeld began a steady recovery; not coincidentally, this period of reintegration also followed the creation of the Bretton Woods international monetary regime a few years after the war. National currencies were once again linked to gold, though in affiliation with the dollar.

“The world economy became increasingly financially integrated in the 1980s and 1990s due to capital account liberalization and financial deregulation. A series of financial crises in Europe, Asia and Latin America followed with contagious effects due to greater exposure to volatile capital flows. The global financial crisis, which originated in the United States in 2007, quickly propagated among other nations and is recognized as the catalyst for the worldwide Great Recession”, according to Wikipedia.

Calomiris and Neal, however, give a brief history of the globalization of financial markets in their work, “History of Financial Globalization, an Overview”, ranging it from the roles the Romans played to the Ottoman Empire, the Chinese and the Japanese. Generally, Italians cities like Genoa and Venice played key roles in the evolution of financial institutions and instruments.

*Federal Reserve Bank*

In 1913, president Woodrow Wilson, 28th President of the United States of America signed a bill creating the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States. It's surprising but this institution has nothing federal about it, it isn't controlled by the United States Government but by other banks and some wealthy individuals and it has no reserve whatsoever. They engage in introducing more money into the economy by printing it out of thin air even though they claim that they don't have the power to do so. Their defined purpose has been to maximize employment, stable prices and ensure moderate long-term interest rates. They find it hard to do their job shown by the multi-trillion-dollar deficit they have and to face the underlying problems by printing more and more money.

This shows very poor handling of the economy in a country by a single entity which has affected other countries that use the US dollar as a reserve currency. The total reliance on a single entity is prone to a lot of flaws which by far outweigh its benefits. This had led to falls in different monetary systems as these entities seem to do as they please or see fit in their sight.

*The Great Depression*

The Great Depression which began in 1929 and lasted until 1939 was the longest and most severe ever experienced. This was due to the stock market crash and bank failures. It greatly devastated the economy as about half of all banks failed,  unemployment rose, housing prices and international trade fell. 
The Great Depression changed the world economy, and it hastened the end of the international gold standard.

In 1971, the dollar was taken off the Gold Standard and devalued to help the economic situation by United States President Richard Nixon. The removal of the dollar off the Gold Standard salvaged the situation but gave the Federal Reserve the ability to print money from thin air.

*The Fall of Money systems*

It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning - Henry Ford

National and regional currencies have been devalued and many more across the globe have the value plunging. America has faced deflation with the Great Depression and Southern Europe is also facing a modern form of the same issue due to the use of the Euro which acts almost like a Gold Standard. The German Mark, after the First World War experienced hyperinflation. Recently, inflation occurred in Venezuela, Zimbabwe and Argentina due to the inflated money supply.

Since November 2016, the Venezuelan Bolivar has suffered inflation rates as high as 1,698,488% printing unlimited money (because of falling oil prices, the major source of income of the country). The government decided to print more money to pay bills which ended up devaluing the currency even further. You can imagine what happened to those who deposited their life savings in venezuelan banks? Gone. All gone due to inflation.

Similarly, in Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwean dollar fell between the late 1990's and 2009. The Zimbabwean government participated in the second Congo war and had to service its financial needs especially with the increasing salary demands of their army. To meet up, they decided to print more money which, alongside a host of other minor factors like the institutional corruption prevalent in the country and the poor economic policies put in place by the government caused a serious dip in the value of the currency.

Governments have failed and there is no guarantee that there would be a breakthrough soon with the current recessions, inflations and various economic instabilities around the world.

In summary, governments have failed throughout history to properly regulate the money supply and the unbanked without access to proper financial services are mostly victims of these governmental failures. Little wonder three quarters of the world's poor are unbanked.
